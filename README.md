		INTRODUCTION

Object detection is a fascinating field in computer vision. It goes to a whole new level when we’re dealing with video data.
We can perform super useful high-value tasks such as surveillance, traffic management, fighting crime, etc. using object detection algorithms.
There are a number of sub-tasks we can perform in object detection, such as counting the number of objects,
finding the relative size of the objects, or finding the relative distance between the objects.
All these sub-tasks are important as they contribute to solving some of the toughest real-world problems.
		

		OPEN CV(computer vision)
In Simple words Computer vision is a field of deep learning that allows the machine to identify, process images just like humans do.
In terms of parsing images humans perform extremely well but when it comes to machines detecting objects involves multiple and complex steps, 
including feature extraction (edges detection, shapes, etc), feature classification, etc.


Computer vision is one of the most exciting divisions of computer science.
A lot of research has been carried in this field for decades.
Processing of images becomes faster and efficient thanks to cloud technologies and powerful GPUs and TPUs.
Cars, robots, and drones start to understand what we see in pictures and videos.
The interface “computer vision” between machines and humans will gain much more importance within the next few years.

		CAR DETECTION 

The uploaded code is used in detecting cars in the given input (video or an image form).
the given input is converted to gray scale image and given to detect multiscale as three factors
1 is grayscale, 2 is scale factor, 3 is Minimum naibours and cascade clasifier uses a data set
to detect any object YOLOV 3 is a good data set.
